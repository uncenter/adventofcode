# Advent of Code

## Runners

Haven't tried all of these, noting for the future!

- Rust: [alycda/AoC-Ornaments](https://github.com/alycda/AoC-Ornaments)
- Gleam: [TanklesXL/gladvent](https://github.com/TanklesXL/gladvent)
- Bun: [`2023/src/`](./2023/src/)

## 2023

Written in TypeScript using the Bun runtime.

```sh
cd 2023/

bun aoc run <RANGE>
bun aoc run 1
bun aoc run 3..5

bun aoc test <RANGE>
bun aoc test 1
bun aoc test 3..5
```

## 2022

Written in Python.

It was fun - thanks [@Boehs](https://github.com/boehs) for introducing me to this!
